### 👋 Hi, I'm Virat Chourasia

Tech founder | Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer

I’m the Chief Tinkerer at [AISuraksha](https://www.aisuraksha.in), an AI-first insurance assistant that helps families understand coverage, prevent fraud, and navigate claims — part of India’s next-gen insurance infrastructure. I’ve previously built real-time systems, semantic search engines, cloud-native microservices, and even a Braille hand glove for the visually impaired.

Currently:
- Playing with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for insurance-specific Q&A
- Exploring GPU programming and model optimization for inference workloads
- Experimenting with building small language models (SLMs) for domain-specific reasoning

Checkout my work, experiments, and hacks — and feel free to connect!
