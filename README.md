### 👋 Hi, I'm Virat Chourasia

Tech founder | Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer | Robotics tinkerer

I’m the Chief Tinkerer at [AISuraksha](https://www.aisuraksha.in), an AI-first insurance assistant that helps families understand coverage, prevent fraud, and navigate claims - part of India’s next-gen insurance infrastructure. I’ve previously built real-time systems, semantic search engines, cloud-native microservices, and even a Braille hand glove for the visually impaired.

### Currently building:
- Playing with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for insurance-specific Q&A
- Exploring GPU programming and model optimization for inference workloads
- Experimenting with building small language models (SLMs) for domain-specific reasoning

### Robotics & Embedded systems (Throwback projects)
- **Robowars Finalist (2012)** — Built a Lambo-style bot from wiper motors, scrapped steel, and a 12V lithium car battery. Reached semi-finals at college Robowars. [📷 Image](https://yourlink.com)  
- **Vision-Guided Bots @ NIT-K & IIT-B** — Team lead for autonomous bots using overhead camera + microcontroller + CC2500 transmission. Picked and placed blocks in Polaroid event at IIT-B Techfest 2013. [📷 Images](https://yourlink.com)  
- **Hexapod All-Terrain Robot (Final Year Project)** — Built terrain-adaptive mobility logic for a six-legged robot. Programmed core movement and gait logic. [📷 Image](https://yourlink.com)
